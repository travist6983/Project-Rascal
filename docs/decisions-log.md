# RASCAL — Agent decisions log

Judgment calls made while building the backend, one line each, with the reason. Settled
decisions from `docs/decisions.md` are not repeated here; this file records only choices
that file left open.

## M0 — Skeleton and tooling

- **The five spec files were at the repo root, not in `docs/`.** Moved them into `docs/`
  with `git mv` rather than stopping — the task's own repo layout puts them there, and the
  history is preserved.
- **psycopg 3 as the driver, not asyncpg.** One `postgresql+psycopg://` URL drives both the
  async application engine and Alembic's sync engine, so there is exactly one connection
  string and no async Alembic template to maintain.
- **Async SQLAlchemy throughout.** FastAPI plus `pytest-asyncio` and `httpx.AsyncClient` are
  async end to end already; a sync session would mean a threadpool hop on every request.
- **`.env` lives at the repo root, not in `api/`.** The Makefile, `docker-compose.yml`, and
  the app all read one file. `rascal.config` resolves it by walking up from the package.
- **Every `uv` command runs from `api/`.** `api/pyproject.toml` is the project root *and* the
  ruff and pytest config root, so running from the repo root would silently ignore both.
- **Postgres on host port 5433.** Straight from the task; keeps a locally installed 5432 usable.
- **`sqlalchemy.url` is absent from `alembic.ini`.** `alembic/env.py` reads `DATABASE_URL`
  through `rascal.config`, so a connection string can only come from one place.
- **Tests own a separate `<dbname>_test` database**, dropped and rebuilt once per session by
  running the real migrations, then truncated between tests. A dev database is never dropped.
- **Tests truncate before each test rather than after.** A failing test leaves its rows
  behind for inspection, and no test can pass on a neighbour's leftovers.
- **A `NullPool` engine per test.** `pytest-asyncio` gives each test its own event loop, and
  a pooled connection opened on a closed loop is a hang waiting to happen.
- **Structured logging is a JSON-lines formatter in `logging_config.py`.** The roadmap allows
  no observability beyond structured logging, and this is the whole of it.
- **`Settings` carries a few tuning constants** (token TTLs, presign TTL, multipart
  threshold, expiry days) that the specs state as prose. Naming them once beats scattering
  literals, and tests can reason about them.
