# RASCAL — blocked

Things I cannot finish because they need a credential or an account only you have. Nothing
here blocks the backend from running: `cp .env.example .env && make up && make migrate &&
make seed && make test` works today, and the acceptance test drives the whole daily loop end
to end.

Last reviewed: **Aug 8, 2026**, after the first run on a machine with a Docker daemon.

## 1. Apple Developer enrollment — blocks real Sign in with Apple

`POST /v1/auth/apple` is fully implemented and tested: it fetches and caches Apple's JWKS,
verifies the signature, and checks `iss`, `aud` against `APPLE_BUNDLE_ID`, and `exp`. The
tests generate a local RSA keypair and stub the JWKS fetch, so the verification logic is
exercised — including a token signed by the wrong key under the right `kid`, which is the
case that catches decorative verification.

What it cannot do is accept a token from a real device, because `aud` has to match a bundle
id from an enrolled team.

**The bundle id is settled: `com.travisterry.childarchive`.** Deliberately name-neutral,
because the app name is still open and a bundle id is permanent. It is already set in
`.env.example` and in `ci.yml`'s test environment, and the Xcode target is signed with it.

**What I still need:** enrollment itself, and then the same value as a Fly secret. Nothing
in the code changes:

```bash
fly secrets set --app rascal-api APPLE_BUNDLE_ID="com.travisterry.childarchive"
```

Registering the App ID with Sign in with Apple enabled is the other half. Adding the
capability in Xcode under automatic signing does that registration for you.

**Meanwhile:** `POST /v1/auth/dev-login` returns a real session with real tokens against a
fixture account, and it works for curl and for the iOS client. It is registered only when
`ENVIRONMENT == "local"`, and there is a test that builds a production app and asserts the
route does not exist.

## 2. AWS credentials — blocks a real upload round-trip

Presigning, multipart planning, and completion are implemented and tested against `moto`, so
the request and response shapes are right and the multipart flow works. Nothing has been
uploaded to a real bucket, because there is no bucket and no credential.

**What I need:** run section 2 of `docs/DEPLOY.md` — bucket, public-access block, versioning,
encryption, CORS, lifecycle rule, IAM user, access key — then set the four S3 secrets. The
IAM policy JSON is in that document, ready to paste.

Two things worth checking by hand afterwards, because `moto` cannot prove either:

- A real presigned PUT from a real device.
- A real multipart upload of a video over cellular. **The CORS rule must expose `ETag`** or
  completion fails in a way that reads like a signature error. The response now carries
  `chunk_bytes`, so the uploader splits at exactly the size the part count was computed from
  — do not hard-code 8MB on the Swift side, read the field.

## 3. Fly and Docker — blocks deployment, and blocks verifying the image

Every artifact exists: multi-stage `Dockerfile`, `fly.toml` with `release_command =
"alembic upgrade head"` and a `/health` check, and a full runbook in `docs/DEPLOY.md`.

**Neon is no longer blocked.** A database exists, and the *Migrate Neon* workflow has run
`alembic upgrade head`, the seed job, and `verify_schema.py` against it: `server_version:
16.14`, revision `0004_full_text_search`, 113 prompts, every table, index, CHECK constraint,
trigger, and stored generated column present by name. Neon accepts this schema — that is a
fact now, not an assumption.

**Docker is no longer blocked. Fly still is.** Everything below the Fly line was executed on
a real machine on **Aug 8, 2026**, with a Docker daemon available for the first time:

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` passes | **executed, green** — dozens of runs, lint plus the full suite against a real Postgres 16 |
| `api/Dockerfile` builds | **executed, green** — builds clean; the `0.8.17` uv pin reads `revision = 3` as intended |
| `api/Dockerfile` *runs* | **executed, green** — non-root `rascal` (uid 1001), venv on PATH, binds `0.0.0.0:8080`, `/health` → `{"status":"ok","db":"ok"}` |
| `docker-compose.yml` starts Postgres | **executed, green** — healthy, after the host port was made overridable |
| `make migrate && make seed && make test` | **executed, green** — `0004_full_text_search`, 113 prompts, 265 passed |
| `dev-login` absent outside `local` | **executed, green** — with `ENVIRONMENT=prod` the real image returns 404 for `/v1/auth/dev-login` and `/v1/debug/*` |

The uv pin question is closed: `0.5.11` could not read the `revision = 3` lockfile, `0.8.17`
can, and the image now builds on a machine rather than in theory.

Two things that only surfaced once a real machine ran this, both fixed:

- **The compose host port was hardcoded to 5433**, which another project's Postgres already
  held. The container stayed in `Created` forever and `make up` looked like it hung. The port
  is now `${POSTGRES_PORT:-5433}`; set `POSTGRES_PORT` and the port in `DATABASE_URL` to the
  same free number.
- **`pg_dump` must be major-version 16, not merely ≥ 16.** A 17 client writes `SET
  transaction_timeout` into the dump, Postgres 16 rejects that parameter on the way back in,
  and `tests/test_restore.py` fails with an error that never mentions versions. `ci.yml` was
  testing for ` 1[6-9]\.` and passed only because today's runner still ships 16; both it and
  `backup.yml` now require 16 exactly and put `/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin` first on PATH,
  because Debian's `pg_dump` is a wrapper that otherwise dispatches to the newest installed
  version. A backup taken by a 17 client would not restore into Neon.

**What I need:** for Fly, sections 1 and 4 of `docs/DEPLOY.md` — create the app, generate a
deploy token, add `FLY_API_TOKEN`, and set the `FLY_DEPLOY_ENABLED` repository variable to
`true`. Until that variable is set the Deploy workflow skips rather than failing, so a push
to `main` is grey instead of red.

## 4. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — resolved. Four batches generated, awaiting your review

**No longer blocked.** The key is set as a repository secret, the *Prompt candidates*
workflow has run, and it opened a pull request that is now merged. `docs/prompt-candidates/`
holds four worksheets, generated by `claude-sonnet-5` against the four thinnest themes in the
library:

| File | Theme | Kind | Accepted |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fears-comfort-2026-08-04.md` | `fears-comfort` | question | 20 of 20 |
| `making-building-2026-08-04.md` | `making-building` | question | 20 of 20 |
| `outdoors-2026-08-04.md` | `outdoors` | question | 19 of 20 |
| `sleep-routine-2026-08-04.md` | `sleep-routine` | question | 20 of 20 |

All four batches are `question`, which is what `--thinnest` asked for and not a spread across
kinds. The activity, photo, video, and audio sides of those themes are still as thin as they
were; generating for them is another run with `--kind`.

**These are unreviewed.** Every candidate below passed the automated filters, and each file
says so in its own header: the filters are a spam trap, not an editor. They catch the four
rejection rules where the rule is textually detectable and nothing else. **79 prompts still
need a human to read them.** One candidate was rejected, in `outdoors`, and the reason is
recorded in that file rather than discarded.

Each file explains its own review process — delete the rows you do not want, move the
survivors into the right table in `docs/mission-library.md`, regenerate the YAML, reseed,
update the coverage numbers `test_seeding.py` asserts, and delete the worksheet in the same
commit. It is a worksheet, not a record.

The original blocker, kept for the record:

### How it was unblocked

`api/scripts/generate_prompts.py` is finished. It reads `docs/mission-library.md` as the
style reference, asks for a batch against a target theme, age band, and kind, and filters
what comes back against the library's four rejection rules — implemented in code, and tested
in `api/tests/test_generate_prompts.py` against real prompts from the library, so a filter
calibrated tightly enough to reject "get on the floor for ten minutes" fails the suite.

Thirty-one tests cover the filters, the near-duplicate check, the request construction, and
the rendering. The one thing they could not cover was the model call itself, because there
was no key in this environment — so the script was complete and entirely unproven.

You added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repository secret and the workflow was dispatched with
`thinnest: 4`, which picked the four themes above (2, 4, 3, and 4 prompts in the library
respectively). Two things came out of the first real run:

- **The first attempt returned a bare `400 Bad Request` and said nothing else**, because
  `httpx.raise_for_status()` discards the response body. The script now prints the API's own
  error, the model it asked for, the instruction length, and the forced tool name.
- **`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` is read with `.strip() or` a default, not `.get(name, default)`.** An
  unset repository variable arrives as an empty string rather than being absent, so the
  original code would have sent `"model": ""`.

The second attempt succeeded with no other change, so **the cause of that first 400 is still
unknown.** It is written down here rather than explained away.

To run it again — a new theme, or a bigger batch:

```bash
# Actions -> Prompt candidates -> Run workflow, or locally:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
cd api && uv run python scripts/generate_prompts.py --thinnest 4
```

Optionally set the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` repository *variable* to pin a model; the script
defaults to a current one. Every run opens its own branch and pull request — never a reused
one, so two batches cannot overwrite each other while one is still open for review.

## Deferred by decision — not blocked, and not waiting on you

These were left out on purpose. Each is a small piece of work if you decide otherwise.

- **`POST /prompts/batch-review`.** Not deferred any more — **cut**, and removed from
  `docs/api-contract.md` rather than left in it as a promise. The review queue it approved
  candidates from is a pull request now: `scripts/generate_prompts.py` writes batches into
  `docs/prompt-candidates/` and the *Prompt candidates* workflow opens a PR with them. A
  branch with a diff is already an accept/reject interface with a comment thread, an audit
  trail, and an undo.
- **`POST /children/{id}/guardians`.** P2 in the contract, and the guardian invite flow is
  out of scope. The `guardians` table, both roles, and the whole authorization path are
  built and tested — a viewer reads and cannot write, and a revoked guardian is refused
  everywhere. Only the invite mechanism is missing.
- **Thumbnails and poster frames.** `POST /media/{id}/complete` marks the row and leaves
  `thumb_key` null. The column exists and clients already handle it being null, so the
  pipeline slots in later with no schema or contract change.
- **The `ORDER BY random()` scan in the moments fallback.** Fine at 100 entries, worth
  revisiting at P1.

## Resolved since the last review

Everything below was on this list on Aug 3 and is now closed.

- The `monthly` slot serving letters alongside measurements — letters have their own slot on
  the 15th.
- The coverage table in `mission-library.md` under-counting four kinds — corrected, and the
  test now asserts the corrected figures exactly.
- `POST /prompts` being open to any authenticated user — behind `require_admin`.
- Deleting an entry stranding its assignment — released back to `pending`.
- `entry_type` describing the prompt rather than the artifact — derived from what the entry
  contains.
- The multipart response not telling the client the chunk size — `chunk_bytes` is in it.
- The sync cursor's lost-update race — a 30-second overlap window, documented in the contract.
- Stale `updated_at` in media write responses — refreshed after the trigger fires.
- A single daily scheduler cron that could only be 5am in one timezone — hourly, filtered on
  each child's local hour.
